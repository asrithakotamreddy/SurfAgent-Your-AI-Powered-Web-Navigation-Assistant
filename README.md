# **SurfAgent — Your AI-Powered Web Navigation Assistant**

## **Problem Statement**

Collecting structured information from the web involves repetitive, manual tasks like searching, clicking, filtering, and copying results. This process is time-consuming, prone to errors, and difficult to automate. Traditional search engines provide raw links or snippets but cannot autonomously perform multi-step actions to deliver clean, structured data tailored to user needs.

## **Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan**

**SurfAgent** is a full-stack AI agent that converts natural-language commands into automated web navigation and data extraction tasks. Users can input queries like:

> “Search for laptops under 50k and list top 5.”

The system works in the following way:

1. A **local Large Language Model (Ollama + LangChain)** interprets the user command and generates a sequence of browser actions, such as search, click, and data extraction.
2. **Playwright** executes these actions autonomously, streams progress, captures logs and screenshots.
3. A **developer-focused dashboard** built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion displays the command input, live browser preview, logs, and structured output.
4. An **exporter module** allows users to save results in JSON or CSV formats.
5. Optional features include voice commands, memory of past queries, multi-task queuing, and error recovery.
